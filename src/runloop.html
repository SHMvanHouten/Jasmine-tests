<!--Loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — var i = 10;.-->
<!--For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output <div>, which we've selected using var output = document.querySelector('.output');. In comments, we've provided you with three code lines that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:-->
<!--var para = document.createElement('p'); — creates a new paragraph.-->
<!--output.appendChild(para); — appends the paragraph to the output <div>.-->
<!--para.textContent = — makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you put on the right hand side, after the equals sign.-->
<!--Different iteration numbers require different text to be put in the paragraph for that iteration (you'll need a conditional statement and multiple para.textContent = lines):-->
<!--If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.-->
<!--If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.-->
<!--For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.-->
<!--Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you don't want i++ — how do you iterate downwards?-->
<!--If you make a mistake, you can always reset the example with the "Reset" button. If you get really stuck, press "Show solution" to see a solution.-->
